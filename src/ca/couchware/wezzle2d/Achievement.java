/**
 * An achievement will hold all the state information required for that 
 * achievement to be successfully completed. Each field will also hold whether
 * it is greater than, less than, or equal to the required value.
 * 
 * for example, an achievement can hold a value such as:  level &lt; 10, 
 * lines = 100, moves &lt; 15.
 *
 * achievemtns will be held within the achievement manager and take a game state
 * as a parameter to their update function. Every iteration of the game loop
 * will have the achievement compare its internal requirements to the game state
 * and evaluate whether or not it has been achieved. If it has been achieved,
 * the evaluate(gamestate) function will return true.
 * 
 * The achievement manager will simply iterate through the list of achievements
 * passing in the current game state and waiting for a response.
 * 
 * If the achievement has been successfully completed, it will be removed from
 * the achievement list and added to the completed list. This will dynamically
 * shrink the amount of searching necessary to check the achievements.
