Version 
Description README file for osxutils package version 1.6 2004-12-20

osxutils is a package of potentially useful Mac-oriented command-line
utilities for Mac OS X version 10.0 or later (although the
functionality of some tools may be specific to later versions). These
tools represent an effort to bring command-line control over certain
aspects of the Mac OS, particularly file meta-data such as Finder
flags, heritage file Type and Creator codes, icons, comments, labels, icons, Finder kind strings, and the display of suffixes / file extensions. 

I would like to note that these are command-line utilities.  They are intended for people who are familiar and comfortable with the
command-line interface.

To keep up with the most recent version of osxutils you can visit the
SourceForge project website at <http://osxutils.sourceforge.net>.
